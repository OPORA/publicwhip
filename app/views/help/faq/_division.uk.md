A division is a formal vote on a motion in the House of Representatives or the Senate. A motion is
a formal proposal put to the House or Senate to take action of some kind.

When a division is called on a particular motion, Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of
Representatives or Senators in the Senate divide themselves into two groups: one that votes
Yes and one that votes No. Each political party has whips who try to persuade their members
to vote along party lines.
